</h2> 


<p>What is income inequality in America and why should it matter to you? Our goal is to help you understand what income inequality looks like and to identify the many components that make up what it takes to live and to thrive in the United States today.</p> 

<p>To do so, we've compiled data and developed visualizations from many different aspects of income inequality in order to establish a storyline of what it looks like today and how you fit into the overall picture. A key component of this picture is the notion of a living wage. To highlight this, we've developed the Interactive Living Wage Calculator which allows you to view today's living wage at a county level, comparing different locations and different versions of a "living wage model". Above all, we hope that you view this tool as an advocate for exploration and education. Income inequality is a serious issue in the United States and it is our hope that this tool will lay the foundation for understanding what you can do to help resolve it for future generations.</p>

<h2>Visualize Income Inequality</h2>

<p>We often hear in the media that there is an ever-growing gap between the wealthy and the poor, but what does that look like and where do you fit? If we look at the evolution of mean household income over the last 50 years, we start to see a significant divide between the top 20% percent of Americans, with respect to the remaining 80%.</p>


<p>For example, let's take a look at a representation of mean household income evolution over the past half-century. Start by considering your current household income and identifying approximately where that places you in the chart today. Is that where you'd expect to fall in the household income spectrum for Americans today? Then, observe the spread between each grouping of Americans and how that spread has become more and more pronounced over time. Why do you think this might have been happening?</p>


<div> 
<img src="images/story/mean-household-income-nominal.png"></img> 
<span class="caption">Figure 1: Mean Household Income Growth, U.S. Census Bureau</span> 
</div> 


<p>To summarize the information above, the increase in mean household income for the top 20% of Americans over the past half-century (~$175 million) is greater than the increase experienced by the remaining 80% of Americans combined (~$135 million)! One way to interpret this is that the purchasing power of the top 20% of Americans is increasing at a outlandishly higher rate than the entire lower 80% of Americans.</p>

<p>We can also look at mean household income from the perspective of growth percentages, year over year. In other words, for each quintile of American households, what was the annual growth in mean household income, expressed as a percentage of the prior year's mean amount?</p>

</div><br>

<p>NOTE THE ISOLATED SPIKES ABOVE, AS WELL AS THE NOTION OF NOMINAL VERSUS REAL INCOME EXPRESSIONS</p>


<p>In addition to simple household income, marginal income can also be an enlightening depiction of income inequality. This is especially true from the perspective of comparing the availability of government assistance and tax benefits as income levels increase. </p>

<div>
<img src="images/story/marginal-income.PNG"></img>
</div><br>

<p>This notion presents a question of whether or not Americans are making enough money to live, or rather, making a true "living wage".</p>


<p>As a reference, Healthcare.gov (maintained by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services), reported that the Federal poverty line for a family of three in 2014 stood at a household income of $20,160. This translated to 46.7 million Americans (or 14.8%) being in poverty in 2014. Looking back to our "Mean Household Income" visual above, 14.8% represents almost two-thirds of those represented by the green line (or bottom quintile).</p>


<p>If our aim is to lift as much of those in poverty above the poverty line, what is being done today to achieve this goal?</p>


<p>Do you think that any of this is acceptable? What can we (or should we) be doing to help lessen the poverty level and to reduce the current household income inequality? To more effectively explore these questions, let's take a deeper look into the household costs that are presumed to be necessary to live in America today. 
</p> 
 

<p> 
<a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-FPL/">Healthcare.gov lists federal poverty level</a> at $20,160 for a family of 3. In 2014, <a href="https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/">14.8% or 46.7 million people</a> were in poverty. Instead of focusing on how much less people near poverty levels make relative to some other group, we want to focus on what it takes to move everyone out of poverty. It is more important to focus on what will lead to everyone earning a living wage. Perhaps the income gap will be reduced, perhaps not.

<h2>Exploring Policy Proposals</h2>

<p>One particular set of topics that relate directly to income inequality is the potential for new policies to be implemented, either at the Federal level or at the state level. This is especially true in an election year (as we are in now), which can re-ignite policy debates surrounding income inequality and wealth redistribution. To be clear, we have NO intention of making policy recommendations or engaging in any debate for or against one policy or another. Instead, we believe that it can be incredibly valuable as an educational tool to explore simple models in order to more deeply understand the major components of any economic policy.</p>

<p>To aid in your exploration of income inequality, we will look at two common proposals:</n> 

<ol>
  <li>Universal Basic Income (or UBI)</li>
  <li>Basic Job Guarantees (or BJG)</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>Let’s start by defining these terms and lay some groundwork for further exploration!</p>

<h4>  
<a id="universal-income" class="anchor" href="#universal-income" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is a Universal Basic Income?
</h4>  


<p>Very simply, UBI is a proposed system that would provide all adults with a standard income nearing the minimum wage in exchange for the removal of Government support programs such as welfare, unemployment, housing assistance, and so forth. There are many variations of a basic income proposal, but this is the essence of UBI, in a nutshell. One possible argument for this model is that current Government assistance programs are inefficiently run and often do not reach a large portion of those who are eligible (either through failures in the process or through a lack of education to the public on eligibility requirements or procedural steps to take advantage of assistance programs). Under UBI, providing a basic income to all adults would place the responsibility of handling basic living expenses back onto citizens and away from Government organizations. Of course, there are many different arguments for and against such a policy, and it is not our intention to engage in any such debates here. Instead, we will use a basic understand of the proposal to estimate a basic cost-benefit model.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in looking more deeply in Universal Basic Income proposals, we would recommend checking out the following articles:</p>


<span class="caption"><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2014/01/03/the-economic-case-for-a-universal-basic-income/">EconoMonitor: "The Economic Case for a Universal Basic Income"; Dolan, E.</n></a></span><br>

<span class="caption"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/wiki/index">Reddit: "BasicIncome"</n></a></span><br>



<p>For our purposes, let’s summarize the elements that we will attempt to include in our UBI model:</n>

<ul>
  <li>Direct Costs of the program (Eligible adults and program administrators)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Approximate annual salary of a “basic job”</li>
    <li>Administrative costs to manage the organization and dispersal of funds</li>
    <li>Continuation of support payments to disabled adults who cannot work, but otherwise qualify for the program’s benefit</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Abstract Costs & Benefits (Larger economic or labor force impacts)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Productivity gains/losses from potential impacts on unemployment (several components)</li>
    <li>Representation of potential changes in job incentives (i.e., does the policy impact the likelihood of someone taking a job rather than staying unemployed?)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

</p>

<h4>  
<a id="basic-jobs" class="anchor" href="#basic-jobs" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is a Basic Jobs Guarantee?
</h4>  


<p>As the name suggests, a BJG proposal focuses on providing a guarantee of employment for any adults that would otherwise be unemployed. The jobs are normally proposed to be near the minimum wage and involve very basic work that may be otherwise less desirable to an adult with options for employment otherwise. In effect, a BJG would serve as somewhat similar to basic income, but with the added caveat of a requirement to fill a basic job in order to get that income. In doing so, the Government would be able to discontinue unemployment and some welfare assistance programs for individuals that receive a basic job, placing the responsibility for managing day-to-day expenses back onto the worker. This basic policy is very similar to the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC), which was a work relief program that provided basic jobs to unemployed, unmarried men between 1933 and 1942. For additional information about the CCC program, check out the following link.</p>


<p>If you’re interested in looking more deeply in Basic Jobs proposals and a comparison with UBI, we would recommend checking out the following article:</p>


<span class="caption"><a href="http://www.rutgerspolicyjournal.org/sites/rutgerspolicyjournal.org/files/issues/2_1/Tcherneva_0.pdf">Rutgers Journal of Law & Urban Policy: "Common Goals - Different Solutions: Can Basic Income and Job Guarantees deliver their own promises"; Tcherneva, P. and Wray, L.</a></span>
<br>


<p>While the model components for basic jobs are similar to a UBI model, there are some subtle differences.Let’s summarize the elements that we will attempt to include in our BJG model:</p><br>

<ul>
  <li>Direct Costs of the program (Eligible workers and program administrators)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Approximate annual salary of a “basic job”</li>
    <li>Administrative costs to manage the organization and dispersal of funds</li>
    <li>Additional administrative costs to reflect the verification process necessary for registering disabled individuals that will qualify for benefits without working</li>
    <li>Continuation of support payments to disabled adults who cannot work, but otherwise qualify for the program’s benefit</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Abstract Costs & Benefits (Larger economic or labor force impacts)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Productivity gains from potential impacts on unemployment</li>
    <li>Representation of potential changes in job incentives (i.e., does the policy impact the likelihood of someone taking a job rather than staying unemployed?)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
</p>


<p>Now that we have a cursory understanding of the thought behind UBI and BJG proposals, one way to continue exploring these notions would be to estimate what the cost-benefit of such policies might look like, if they were ever implemented. For our purposes, we can keep our models simple. Attempting to calculate an incredibly precise outcome would require an equally complex model, which is far more than we need to explore an economic policy at a high level. Instead, we can identify a few key considerations and use those basic notions to quantify potential outcomes over a range of potential impacts that vary based on probabilities that we assign. </p>

<h4>  
<a id="monte-carlo-simulations" class="anchor" href="#monte-carlo-simulations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building a Model for Monte Carlo Simulations 
</h4>  


<p>One powerful tool for estimating outcomes based on a probabilistic set of variables is Monte Carlo Analysis, and while it may sound overly complicated, we actually only need three components in order to conduct this kind of analysis:</n>

<ol>
  <li>Basic model components (i.e., inputs and variable components for our model)</li>
  <li>An understanding of how our model’s components interact with one another to quantify an outcome value (ex. if we show costs and benefits, how we might expect those values to impact one another)</li>
  <li>A standard of estimation (i.e., how much variation to allow in each component of our model)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Once these components are defined and placed into a model, Monte Carlo analysis would allow us to run batches of simulations in order to estimate an outcome according to our model definitions. </p>

<p>If you’d like to the mechanics of Monte Carlo Analysis any further, you might consider perusing any of the following article:</p>

<span class="caption"><a href="http://www.manufacturing.net/article/2012/11/demystifying-monte-carlo">"Demystifying Monte Carlo"; Nicol, A., Manuafacturing.net</a></span><br>


<p>Let’s start with exploring potential outcomes for a simple UBI policy. To do so, we can begin by identifying some of the direct costs and benefits of such a program.</p>

<p>First, we can define some details about our environment, which have been listed below with links to the source of each of our data points:</n>

<ul>
  <li>Number of adults in the U.S. = 245,201,076 adults</li>
  <li>Size of the labor force = 156,090,000 adults</li>
  <li>Number of (registered)) disabled adults = 27,102,850 adults</li>
  <li>Value of a “basic income” = $15,080 (equals minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, over 40 hours per week and 52 weeks in a year)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>With these values (which will apply to both the UBI and BJG models), we can move into defining the high-level models for the implementation of UBI or BJG proposals.</p>

<p>Note that two VERY IMPORTANT influences in our choice of model construction and Monte Carlo simulation stemmed from Chris Stucchio and Jeremy Scheff. Stucchio conjured up this notion of exploration through modeling, while Scheff offered several potential enhancements or corrections to Stucchio's models. While many reacted to Stucchio's methodology assome sort of biased attempt to favor one policy or another, we chose to apprecate his approach as a method for beginning the conversation, so to speak. That is, creating models and simulating potential outcomes can be an incredibly powerful method for exploring the impacts of economic policies. It's one thing to express a qualitative opinion to policy debates, but it's an entirely different thing to actually attempt to place values alongside your opinions. It is with this motivation that we chose to explore and implement our UBI and BJG models through Monte Carlo simulation.</p>

<p>Given the significance of their methodology to our policy exploration, we would highly recommend taking a look through both Stucchio and Scheff's respective modelling approaches:</p>

<a id="model-execution" class="anchor" href="#model-execution" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>UBI and BJG Model Results
</h4>

In order to define and execute our model simulations, we chose to use Python as a means for model construction and result output. Using the high-level model attributes and economic statistics detailed above, our model simulations produced the following result:

<div>
<img src="images/story/monte_carlo_result.png"></img>
</div>
<br>

<p>What do these results tell us?</p>

<p>First off, our result is showing us the simulated cost/benefit of implementing each policy proposal. The X axis shows us the cost/benefit in trillions USD, where a positive number represents a residual cost overall and a negative number reflects a residual benefit. The Y axis represents the number of simulations producing a results of each value. Since Monte Carlo simulations allow us to run thousands of simulations (or more), we are especially interested in how the results are distributed. In reviewing our results, we can see that the results for a Basic Jobs Guarantee are much more spread out that those for Basic Income. This tells us that, according to our model and potential unknowns, results from our BJG model possess a much larger variance in outcome, whereas UBI may be more certain in terms of quantifying the monetary impact overall. Their estimated impacts, though, are actually quite similar. We must emphasize, though, that this is a function of our model. If we were to alter any of our parameters or add/remove specific variables, our results may change a great deal.</p>

<p>So, what should you take away from this? The most important takeaway from this analysis is that any policy debate or public consideration can (and should) be aided by attempts to quantify potential impacts. It is crucial to any debate that you understand as much about any potential impacts (good or bad) as possible. Building a model can be incredibly effective in the learning process and often develops an environment that is much more conducive to open debate and intellectual growth.</p>
