<p>What is income inequality and why should it matter to you? Our goal is to help you understand what income inequality looks like and to identify the many components that make up what it takes to live and to thrive in the United States today.</p> 


<p>We often hear in the media that there is an ever-growing gap between the wealthy and the poor, but what does that look like and where do you fit? If we look at the evolution of mean household income over the last 50 years, we start to see a significant divide between the top 20% percent of Americans, with respect to the remaining 80%.</p>


<p>For example, let's take a look at Doug Short's representation of mean household income evolution over the past half-century. Start by considering your current household income and identifying approximately where that places you in the chart today. Is that where you'd expect to fall in the household income spectrum for Americans today? Then, observe the spread between each grouping of Americans and how that spread has become more and more pronounced over time. Why do you think this might have been happening?</p>

</div> 


<p>To summarize the information above, the increase in mean household income for the top 20% of Americans over the past half-century (~$175 million) is greater than the increase experienced by the top 80% of Americans combined (~$135 million)! What this tells us is that the purchasing power of the top 20% of Americans is increasing at a higher rate than the entire lower 80% of Americans' purchasing power.</p>


<p>In addition to simple household income, marginal income can also be an enlightening depiction of income inequality. This is especially true from the perspective of comparing the availability of government assistance and tax benefits as income levels increase. </p>

</div>

<p>This notion presents a question of whether or not Americans are making enough money to live, or rather, making a true "living wage".</p>


<p>As a reference, Healthcare.gov (maintained by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services), reported that the Federal poverty line for a family of three in 2014 stood at a household income of $20,160. This translated to 46.7 million Americans (or 14.8%) being in poverty in 2014. Looking back to our "Mean Household Income" visual above, 14.8% represents almost two-thirds of those represented by the green line (or bottom quintile).</p>


<p>If our aim is to lift as much of those in poverty above the poverty line, what is being done today to achieve this goal?</p>


<p>Do you think that any of this is acceptable? What can we (or should we) be doing to help lessen the poverty level and to reduce the current household income inequality? To more effectively explore these questions, let's take a deeper look into the household costs that are presumed to be necessary to live in America today. 
</p> 
 

<p> 
<a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-FPL/">Healthcare.gov lists federal poverty level</a> at $20,160 for a family of 3. In 2014, <a href="https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/">14.8% or 46.7 million people</a> were in poverty. Instead of focusing on how much less people near poverty levels make relative to some other group, we want to focus on what it takes to move everyone out of poverty. It is more important to focus on what will lead to everyone earning a living wage. Perhaps the income gap will be reduced, perhaps not.

<p>For the purposes of our analysis, let's summarize primary components of a living wage as follows:</n>
<ul>
  <li>Housing Cost</li>
  <li>Healthcare Cost</li>
  <li>Food Cost</li>
  <li>Taxes (including Federal and State taxes)</li>
  <li>Transportation</li>
  <li>Other (including cost of basic necessities like clothing, toiletries, and other miscellaneous consumer products)</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>Use this area to walk through our logical model construction, noting logical differences between MIDS and MIT</p>

</h4> 

 
<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile.
